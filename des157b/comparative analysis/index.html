            <p>I was inspired by the layout of this website. The site included a 3D gallery where students could display their 
                work and also look at other students' work. Additionally, users can click the Courses menu and Category menu to 
                access different disciplines they are interested in looking at. I think that is a good way to show the variety of the
                school's disciplines and also create a place for students to collaborate with other students. I plan to collect free
                resoureces from different areas in order to help students who have limited educational resoureces have the equal opportunities 
                as other students.</p>

              <p>This website is similar to the Grays degree, it also was a show for graduation students. One thing I was inspired by this site 
                is designers classify the disciplines by the name of the disciplines and that is very helpful for users to easily find out the thing 
                they are looking for. One more thing is users also can either enlarge or shrink the images. </p>
