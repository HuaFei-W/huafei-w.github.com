        <div class="one">
            <h1>Project summary: </h1>
            <p>This project will focus on providing free textbook resources for students from 
            different social classes to connect with the same education. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
            <h1>Project Goals: </h1>
            <p>The goal of this project is to create a community where users can obtain free text
            books in PDF and also users can swap textbooks directly with other users of the platform 
            without having to pay. So that everyone can access the same opportunity in education by 
            providing free resources for textbooks. Additionally I want to create an opportunity for 
            users to meet new people when they exchange textbooks with other users. </p>
        <div class="three">
            <h1>Design Strategies:</h1>
            <p>The overall layout of the page will be friendly, simple and with a warm and bright
            color scheme. In terms of typography, I plan to use a Serif font inspired by the classical
             vibe that many old books have and paired it with a sans serif font for easy reading and also 
             to enhance the modern look. Finally, there will be a landing page like a tutorial and let the 
             user know what they can achieve with the website. The main page will display a 3D gallery with a 
             different textbook cover where users can look around the textbook and click the category menu to 
             access different disciplines they are interested in looking at.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="four">
            <h1>Interaction Strategies:</h1>
            <p>For the Interaction part, the free PDF link will display after the user clicks on the textbook. 
                And also users can see who wants to swap this textbook in the same page. Once the user clicks the 
                swap button, he/she will upload textbooks photos which he/she wants to swap and ask  for exchange. 
                So they can start swapping the textbooks at a ratio 1:1 and also users can add the textbooks to this 
                swap page also where other users can see this post. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="five">
            <h1>Experience Goals:</h1>
            <p>I want users who visit this platform to have the chance to discover new things and learn some new things. 
                I also want students from different social classes to have a chance to meet with new people and be willing 
                to listen to someoneâ€™s experience. The most important thing is to foster reading and a sense of community and sharing.
